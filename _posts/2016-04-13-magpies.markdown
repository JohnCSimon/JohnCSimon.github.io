I'm rather liking the [Jekyll site generation engine](https://jekyllrb.com) though I suppose I'll be regularly checking back to [Gruber's markdown guide](https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/syntax) repeatedly to look up what a specific ## tag ## does. 

All in all I'm hoping this'll be semi weekly updated blog that'll contain what I'm covering in my various software/codemonkey studies. 

## Stuff I'm interested in 

### Functional Languages! ###
>
> *   Elixir.
>
> *   F#
>
> *   Scala
>
> *   Haskell (lower priority)

### JVM! ###
> Getting more familiar with the JVM world. I've been on `.NET` for the longest time and I'm way overdue to gain expertise on `C#`'s more popular cousin.
> 
> * Modern Java 8 
>
> * Spring
> 
> * Maven

### Cloud! ###
> * As much as people rag on certs - [Amazon's various aws certs] (https://aws.amazon.com/certification/)
